* Cleaning the files
  The least straightforward part is that some nutrients are "duplicated". The
  list was obtained using the following code:
  #+BEGIN_SRC python
  nutrients_to_join = list(filter(
      lambda g: len(g) > 1,
      nutrient[['nutrient_nbr']].astype(int)
      .groupby('nutrient_nbr').groups.values()))
  for nut in nutrients_to_join:
      rows = (nutrient[["name", "nutrient_nbr"]].iloc[nut]
              .to_csv(sep="|").split("\n"))
      rows.insert(1, "-+-+-")
      for r in rows:
          if r != "":
              print(f"|{r}|")
      print()

** Carbohydrates
   These are just different methods of obtaining their value. We will *average*
   the methods.
   
   Units: g
   |   id | name                        | nutrient_nbr |

   | 1005 | Carbohydrate, by difference |        205.0 |
   | 1050 | Carbohydrate, by summation  |        205.2 |
   
** Sugars
   None of the foods have both kinds of sugar measurement. We will use
   ~np.nanmean~ out of convenience, but we are just combining the columns.

   | 2000 | Sugars, total including NLEA |        269.0 |
   
** Vitamin A (Retinol), α- and β-Carotenes
   According to [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta-Carotene#Retinol_activity_equivalents_(RAEs)][Wikipedia]], all of these contribute to the total amount of
   Vitamin A (Retinol) in the food. They have different contribution factors. We
   also have ~1104: Vitamin A, IU~ expressed in IU, which should take care of
   the factors already (*I haven't checked*).

   | 1104 | Vitamin A (IU)      |          320 |
   
** Lycopene
   [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lycopene][Wikipedia]] does not mention any differences in absorption.
   
   |   id | name           | nutrient_nbr |
   |------+----------------+--------------|

** Lutein / Zeaxanthin 
   |   id | name                  | nutrient_nbr |

** Definitions of Dietary Reference Intakes (DRI) (Copyright National Academy of Sciences)
   > The DRIs expand upon and replace the RDAs and RNIs with four categories of
   values intended to help individuals /optimize/ their health, prevent disease,
   and avoid consuming too much of a nutrient /(emphasis mine)/
  
   [[./img/dri-definition.png]]
   
*** Box 2 DRI Definitions  
    - Estimated Average Requirement (EAR): The average daily nutrient intake level
      that is estimated to meet the requirements of half of the healthy individuals
      in a particular life stage and gender group.
    - Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA): The average daily dietary nutrient intake
      level that is sufficient to meet the nutrient requirements of nearly all
      (97–98 percent) healthy individuals in a particular life stage and gender
      group.
    - Adequate Intake (AI): The recommended average daily intake level based on
      observed or experimentally determined approximations or estimates of
      nutrient intake by a group (or groups) of apparently healthy people that
      are assumed to be adequate; used when an RDA cannot be determined.
    - Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL): The highest average daily nutrient intake
      level that is likely to pose no risk of adverse health effects to almost all
      individuals in the general population. As intake increases above the UL, the
      potential risk of adverse effects may increase.

** Protein requirements  
   Source: https://www.who.int/nutrition/publications/nutrientrequirements/WHO_TRS_935/en/
   
   *From section 7.10:*
   - Median adult: 0.66 g/(kg day)
   - 97.5th percentile adult: 0.83 g/(kg day)
 
   *From section 14.2:*
   > No safe upper limit has been identified, and it is unlikely that intakes of
   twice the safe level are associated with any risk. However, caution is
   advised to those contemplating the very high intakes of 3–4 times the safe
   intake.
   
*** Essential amino-acid requirements 
   
   *From Section 8 and Table 23:*

   | Amino-acid name          | mg/(kg day) |
   |--------------------------+-------------|
   | Histidine                |          10 |
   | Isoleucine               |          20 |
   | Leucine                  |          39 |
   | Lysine                   |          30 |
   | Methionine               |        10.4 |
   | Cysteine                 |         4.1 |
   | Phenynalamine + tyrosine |          25 |
   | Threonine                |          15 |
   | Tryptophan               |           4 |
   | Valine                   |          26 |
   
  
   Looking at Figure 14, the protein profiles of all foods (including potato,
   rice, maize, soya; except cassava) are very close to the required pattern of
   amino-acids.
   
   [[./img/who-trs-fig14.png]]

*** Safe upper intakes of indispensable amino-acids (24% higher than table above)
    *From section 8.4 "Safe intakes of indispensable amino acids":*
    
    > There is no information on the variability of requirements for individual
    amino acids. Therefore, approximate values were calculated on the assumption
    that the inter-individual coefficient of variation of the requirements
    foramino acids is the same as that for total protein, i.e. 12%. On this
    basis, thesafe levels of intake for the indispensable amino acids are 24%
    higher thanthe values for average requirement shown in the first column of
    Table 23.

** Iron and Zinc requirements
   > The requirement for iron is 1.8 times higher for vegetarians due to the
   lower bioavailability of iron from a vegetarian diet.

   > The requirement for zinc may be as much as 50 percent greater for
     vegetarians, particularly for strict vegetarians whose major food staples
     are grains and legumes.
